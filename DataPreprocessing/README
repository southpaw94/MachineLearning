This directory contains several programs which display several different
feature selection techniques, which can be used to reduce the dimensions of
the training dataset. This is beneficial because it reduces the overhead of
the machine learning algorithm, allowing an hypothesis to be reached sooner
than otherwise possible. An overview of each program follows.

	1. sbs.py: This file contains the sbs class, which stands for
	   sequential backwards selection. Effectively, this loops through the
	   hypotheses determined via each feature, determines which feature
	   has the least impact on the hypothesis, and removes it. This
	   process repeats until the specified number of features remains.
	2. sbs_test.py: This is a test of the sbs class. It displays the 
	   accuracy of the model versus the number of features in the model
	3. WineDataSet.py:
